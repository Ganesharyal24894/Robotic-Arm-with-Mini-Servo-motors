# Robotic-Arm-with-Mini-Servo-motors
This repository is for documenting a project that I had made in my initial days of learning Robotics and Embedded Systems.

The project that I had made was a simple robotic arm that was driven by mini servo motors and controlled by analog inputs, with the feature of learning the movements taught by the operator and repeating them when needed.

Here is a link to see the project working - https://studio.youtube.com/video/LqPJqpzlTKQ/edit
